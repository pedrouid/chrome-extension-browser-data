## Chrome Extension Browser Data

This is a demo chrome extension that scrapes all browser data from any website and sends it to a server. A simple example of how insecure browsers are right now without encrypted storage. Something similar to Apple's Keychain with a client-side encryption supported by the browser would prevent this.
