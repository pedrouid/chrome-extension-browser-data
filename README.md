## Chrome Extension Browser Data

This is a demo chrome extension that scrapes all browser data from any website and sends it to a server. This example Chrome Extension has the same permissions as popular extensions such as AdBlock and Pocket.

This demontrastes how vulnerable browsers are right now to browser extensions without access to an user-encrypted local storage. Something similar to Apple Keychain or Android Keystore available as native API by the browser would prevent this easily.
